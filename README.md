## Data Sources

### Main Hate Crime Dataset
The data in hate_crime.csv and hate_crime_documentation are FBI crime statistics from the website https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs

This data set is too big to fit on a github repo (52mb when the max is 50...) so for now I'll just allude to the data set until I can figure out a fix for this so the code is reproducible on other computers. 

### Population estimates 

The data in nst-est2019-01.xlsx is a data set from the US Census bureau that contains population estimates for the different states over time. I found this on wikipedia, but it's from one of their citations, and links to the US census Bureau's website. It is cited as follows:
> "Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019". 2010-2019 Population Estimates. United States Census Bureau, Population Division. December 30, 2019. Retrieved January 27, 2020.

the link for this data set is https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2019/state/totals/nst-est2019-01.xlsx?#
